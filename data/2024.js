After encountering a similarly-minded Haruka Amami, they free Tito Dick, Sens, Felix the Cat and Donkey Kong. The trio attempt to free Grand Dad but fail, discovering a power siphon that leads to a higher floor. However, they are intercepted by Haltmann, who takes them to Floor 99. Within his lab, he reveals his desire to bring back Susie using the SiIva AI, whom he commands to attack the three.<br><br>The AI summons the Fighting Reject Team to buy time whilst charging up an energy blast; Meta Knight sacrifices himself to redirect the blast to Haltmann's vessel but is saved by Nozomi - the energy blast hits (see <b>The SiIvaGunner All-Star Nuclear Winter Festival</b>, December 1, 2022), exposing Haltmann's computer, which Santa fails to destroy. Nozomi then hijacks Haltmann's vessel to overload the AI (see <b>Goodbye to a World Fusion Collab</b>, December 24, 2022) and forces it to shut down, leaving Haltmann thoroughly defeated. Santa offers him a chance at redemption, but he is killed by The Voice - since he was a figment, all memory of him is erased.<br><br>The Voice summons the trio to Floor 100, where he surrounds them with an overwhelming force of guards, Spherics and Stringbots - a fight ensues, but it is interrupted by the rescued figments plus Grand Dad, who manage to overpower the troops. Grand Dad attempts to knock out The Voice, but is blasted out of the tower by a laser gun, turning the tide of battle back in his favor; he then tables terms of surrender to the heroes, which they refuse. As The Voice is about to deliver the final blow, Haruka appears with the wounded Grand Dad as the trio sense SiIvaGunner - who had felt Grand Dad's pain - awakening...",

Eventually, one of the first hunter's shots is enough to startle the Mothman into dropping a sleeping bag it was carrying before flying away, which turned out to be a bunch of rocks. As each hunter contemplates their experience with the Mothman, the narrator concludes the video by suggesting that the existence of the Mothman may remain a mystery forever. ",
