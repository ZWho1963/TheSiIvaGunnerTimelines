Having arrived to contain an anomaly as per the Haltmann Works Company's new directive, E. Gadd tells Waluigi to run as he begins fighting against WEEGEE. This battle ends with E. Gadd capturing WEEGEE with the Poltergust, with E. Gadd planning on informing Dr. Andonuts about his newly-captured specimen. In the hotel's lobby, Wario and Waluigi learn about WEEGEE being captured and decide to become the new owners of the hotel, seeing an opportunity to get rich. Unfortunately for the dastardly duo, the WEEGEE towers disappear as a result of WEEGEE's capture, leaving both of them without a job once more. Some time later, Robbie Rotten contacts Bobbie, Tobbie and Flobbie and requests their assistance in his latest scheme (being the events of Season's Greetings).",
